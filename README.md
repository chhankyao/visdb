# VisDB: Visibility-aware Dense Body



## Introduction

This repo contains the PyTorch implementation of "[Learning Visibility for Robust Dense Human Body Estimation]()" (ECCV'2022). Extended from a heatmap-based representation in [I2L-MeshNet](https://github.com/mks0601/I2L-MeshNet_RELEASE), we explicitly model the dense visibility of human joints and vertices to improve the robustness on partial-body images. 


## Quick demo


## Usage

The code is implemented with Python3 and PyTorch CUDA. Our code is mainly built upon this repo: [I2L_MeshNet](https://github.com/mks0601/I2L-MeshNet_RELEASE).
